## Jenkins

**Jenkins** is an open-source automation tool that helps to automate various parts of the software development process such as building, testing, and deploying applications. It supports **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Delivery (CD)**.

You can use **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)** to deploy a **Jenkins** application on AWS in a matter of minutes.

This tutorial walks you through the process of deploying a Jenkins application. You will launch an **EC2 instance**, install and configure **Jenkins** on that instance.
